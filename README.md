# Remote Controlled Car
The project was realized by a team of five third semester students at University of Southern Denmark, studying electronics engineering. At the beginning of the semester, we had a meeting, where we distributed the tasks, so each of us had been working on a different part of the project, from enclosure design to PCB design and programming. The final report was a compilation of parts written by each of us about what we worked on. In addition, we had to write the introduction and ending.

The Gantt chart was used to showcase the project timeline and to make sure we as a team are in time to finalize the project within the given timeframe. It can be seen in the following picture:

Regarding components, we had a fixed budget from the university of 1k DKK to order components necessary for the PCB and enclosure. As it can be seen in the following picture, we used a total of 970 DKK out of the total budget of 1000 DKK.

For designing the PCB, KiCad was used and we generated a schematic and a PCB layout:
